# project
The name of the project is Image Steganography using AES and the purpose of this project is to make the data transmission more secure and 
comparison analysis of encryption decryption algorithms. As this project is not very large hence additional features have to be updated
in this project. Till now, I completed Image Steganography using AES and also implemented TripleDES.The application is able to encrypt 
the message first using encryption and hide it in an image using key. After hiding message in the image,the encrypted message is retrieved
using the same key and decryption algorithm. The efficiency/time taken by the encryption decryption algorithm is checked.

Some part of coding is done by my project partner "Kushagra Ahuja". He coded the encryption decryption using DES.
