# The Title of the project is Image Steganography using AES in C#. We have developed an desktop application that provides an easy interface to encrypt and decrypt data. The plain text is first encrypted and then hidden in an image using a key and the data is retrived back using the same key by the user. The application also provides an option for several more algorithms like DES TripleDES for the process as well as for performance comparison. I have been working on the DES alogorithm and the UI section of the Application
