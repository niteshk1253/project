# The Title of the project is Image Steganography using AES/DES in C#. We have developed an desktop application that provides an easy interface to encrypt and decrypt data & hide it in an image. The plain text is first encrypted and then hidden in an image using a key and the data is retrieved back using the same key by the user. The application also provides an option of AES/DES for the process as well as for performance comparison. Hence, the efficiency/time taken by the encryption decryption algorithm is checked. I have been working on the Steganogrphy, AES alogorithm in this application and the DES & UI section of the Application has been completed by Kushagra Ahuja.
